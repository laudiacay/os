I worked alone. I believe all features work, because I pass all the provided tests.


To test my code:
i'll call this directory $p2dir, start in this directory.

cp $(location of p2test.tar) .
tar -xvf p2test.tar
cp release/* p2dir

# go into test.csh, uncomment lines 10 and 12, set test_input_dir = $p2dir

./run_all_tests.csh
# passes everything! :)


to stress-test my code:
# still in $p2dir
cp *.c stress-test/
cp *.h stress-test/
cd stress-test/
make
./testCounter
./testList
./testHash
# passes everything! :)
