i worked on this alone

i believe everything works! may have misinterpreted how you want unlink to work (i had it consolidate the direntries to decrease fragmentation and save space) but it passes all the tests.

you'll need to set MFS_SERVER and MFS_PORT to run the tests, also add $(pwd) to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

i tested on a very slow machine, so my timeout may need tweaking on line 29 of mfs.c if my code fails tests 41+ on your machine- hopefully won't be an issue, but you never know.
